## Problem Statement

### Freelancers

1. Research showed that around 59% of freelancers were owed $50,000 or more for completed work, with 72% of respondents saying they still have outstanding invoices yet to be paid by their clients.

2. Project acquisition was chosen to be the biggest problem in the freelance career by 52% of the respondents of a survey
3. About 22% of freelancers feel that contract negotiation is a really big problem. The vagueness of the demand of clients that leads to dissatisfaction is often a pain point for freelancers.
    
    [https://freelancermap.com/market-study](https://t.co/7ahcUkstOr)
    
4. Freelancers often struggle with juggling different projects at the same time. Due to this, there can be a problem in scheduling a task according to the preferences of a client.

### Clients

1. Clients face a backlash when the work they demanded is not delivered on time or is not at par with their expected quality which is a major issue surrounding growing businesses that rely heavily on the freelancing community.
2. Clients have to go through a lot of time consuming processes in connecting and delegating work with the freelancers.
3. Clients feel great difficulty in accessing and managing their payments. A lot of ongoing gigs, and a lack of trustworthy universal automation payment mechanism leads to management issues.
4. Owing to the ease with which a freelancer can fake their skills, they often might end up stuck in a gig with an incompetent freelancer. No immutable way of freelancer skill/history verification.

## Understanding the Market & Niche Identification

An in-depth understanding of the market space is extremely important when we‚Äôre dealing with such a revolutionary technology, for which the skepticism against is equally high.

Considering the increasing bearish state, the world is entering into against crypto, and specifically India (Due to increasing Taxation), decision of the domain we wish to tap into was a really essential one

After much discussion and thought, despite the fact that the freelance sector is way bigger, we decided to start with, pretty intuitively, the web3 developers itself for they are the only ones, who, at the current moment recognize and understand how these systems actually work and how blockchain isn‚Äôt only about Dogecoin. 

Observation and analysis of the existing Socio-Economic set-up of the gig sector tell us that **just a listing platform cannot be complete solution**.

We have realized that the problem can be catered into three major domains:

- **Payment, Escrow, and Product Managementüí∏**
- **ListingüìÉ**
- **Validation of Work doneü§ù**

Sticking to a Payment and Product management system and becoming a needed tool for Freelancers is what we are aiming for in the initial stages, soon making our way into the Listing and Validation domain as and when we develop the community to ensure the smooth functioning of the same, with the aim of becoming a one-stop platform 3-5 years down the line.

The reason for the above path is attributed to the very nature of problems, Both validation and Listing, especially Word of Mouth based, need active communities and models like Social Commerce to support them.

Furthermore, harnessing the network effort of the increasing trust in the technologies being employed due to increasing awareness and education, we would subsequently be able to tackle practically every freelance domain, from web2 to music to art.

**The ultimate aim is to become for freelance, what Google is to search for something.** 

<aside>
ü§î **Why blockchain?**

Today is the age where transparency and data security are highly valued in all fields. Blockchain, with its decentralization, puts the power in the hands of the users; transparency is something that is majorly lacking from the existing incumbents. Example: Upwork is Completely client-oriented; Not only is the power taken, but also the freelancer is devoid of essential transparency, which is something that blockchain guarantees, furthermore, RevereLabs has put forward mechanisms to ensure, not only the freelancer but also the client is increasingly ensured work security (Explained later)

This enables us to establish a model wherein we can harness the power of blockchain to fulfill our **CSR (Corporate social responsibility)** by giving control and transparency in the hands of the people who so much deserve it. Furthermore, the Incorporation of blockchain enables us to increase the flexibility of our service multiple times, and the amalgamation of **NFTs** and **Tokenization** always possesses the power to change the socio-economic dynamics of social platforms in a way that former web2-based incumbents may dare not even think about. 

Similar to the model of Huddle01, where we see how the introduction of blockchain could revolutionize a field formerly captured by their respective web2 incumbents (Zoom), and subsequently, how readily people shift to web3 alternatives as a part of ensuring the promise of trust, privacy, and transparency, not to mention the immense flexibility in the use case of Huddle01 with their tokenization and NFTs.

## Solution Statement

We introduce a **No-code Smart-Contract based Escrow system**:

- **No-code:** As the freelancer or client, the complete power lies in your hands, customize the flexible templates as per your needs with just a few clicks and no prerequisites about coding.
- **Smart-Contract:** Smart Contracts are a bunch of code deployed on the blockchain. As the popular saying goes ‚Äî anything that goes on the blockchain, stays on the blockchain. They guarantee a fund-release if and when the gig is completed, or a refund to client in case the gig isn‚Äôt completed.
- **Escrow system:** An Escrow is a legal entity that acts like a judge between the two parties. Is the escrow reliable? When they‚Äôre humans - maybe not. But when they‚Äôre pieces of code - 100%.

‚≠ê Escrow + No-code + Smart Contract = **RevereLabs**

## What makes us, us - Distinguishing Features Explained

### Staking

A web3 collateralization mechanism wherein the trust is further enforced using a staking system, both freelancers and clients have the option to stake their token/money, to gain a competitive advantage at the risk of losing the staked amount in case of defaulting on payments or project delivery respectively.

### Multi-Sig

Stand for Multi-Signature. It makes it possible to ensure the consent and agreement of two parties on different sides of the transactions. Each detail of the smart contract is mutually agreed upon using multi-sig, wherein both parties have to sign using their public IDs, with a click of a button.

### **DAO-Listing**

DAO, despite their very decent introduction to the web3 ecosystem, they are slowly making their way up proving the power and potential communities possess. We hope to leverage this power of DAOs to create an efficient and adaptive listing system.

### Milestones

Why get paid when the whole work‚Äôs done? Some gigs could go on for months. This is where milestones can help. Parties can mutually decide milestones (or stages of work). This ensures continuous payment to the freelancer and a proper estimate of the latter‚Äôs quality to the client. 

### **2-Minute Contracts**

We hope to scale down, both the time and the involved complexity of making an agreement contract, one shouldn‚Äôt have to spend the time when programs can simply the whole process multiple times.

### NFT ‚Üí NTF? Non Transferable, but Fungible + Upgradability

A common problem among freelancers is the non-certification model of the current gig economy. Freelancers don‚Äôt have any proof for their work (compare it with internships). RevereLabs introduces NFT badging for reviews received from clients, which are un-fakable, blockchain-secured tokens of recognition of their work.

1. Non-Transferable ‚Üí We restrict the transferability of NFTs for the essence we want to cultivate is how one must actually earn one themselves. One feature of World of Warcraft that is second nature to its players, but goes mostly undiscussed outside of gaming circles, is the concept of¬†*soulbound*¬†items. A soulbound item, once picked up, cannot be transferred or sold to another player. Such would be our NFTs, to ensure their true validity and value is maintained.
2. Upgradability ‚Üí NFTs are designed in a unique upgradable fashion, where the upgradability generally might either reflect the milestones or %age progressed in the gig. This makes the NFTs much more flexible and comprehensive into something that might actually posses utility from a profiling point of view. 

<aside>
ü§î **The Hard Side- What about the client?**

The proposed service is, for sure, extremely beneficial to the freelancer as the staked amount provides security for their work. To cater to the client‚Äôs needs, it‚Äôs been one of our prime areas of concern to ensure that the client doesn‚Äôt end up being the one who is duped. To ensure the same, prior to the client staking their money share, we add a layer prior to it, considering that money is something a lot of freelancers might not have; they have to thus, complete a sample (exact percent can be mutually decided) of the task to showcase their interest and future commitment, similar to how Requests for Proposals (RFP) work. After the successful completion of the same, the client is then required to stake the milestone-based amount necessary for the work to resume, and thus the project unfolds like a cradle between the freelancer and client, respectively doing the job and ensuring timely payment to ensure no biases are created, and trust is provided at each step taken.

</aside>

## Business Model

The introduction of blockchain technology opens the doors for revenue generation via tokenomics too. The main revenue scheme revolves around the following three pillars:

‚Üí 1-4% Commission per transaction cost taken equally from freelancer and client.

‚Üí 0% fee for the transaction using native token, hence appreciating the value of the token

‚Üí Money lending in case of inability of the client to stake money.

## **Product and MVP**

- Our first Working MVP is currently being developed and would be released on 22nd Aug!

## **Networking and Marketing**

To ensure that we are in touch with ground realities, we made it one of our primary tasks to ensure to talk to as many freelancers and clients as possible to be able to dive into the root of the existing systems. We are also talking to a lot of chains to get the idea built with collaboration and been attending a lot of Web3 Meetups. For the most part, we **noticed a need for such a no-code smart-contract-based escrow system** which helped us validate our idea, and constructive criticism which helped us polish the areas where we lack.üí™

We recently started our Alpha Testing Discord which we soon hope to transform into a full-fledged community : [https://discord.gg/w8tW5sASd4](https://discord.gg/w8tW5sASd4)

## Competition

We have in-detailed analyzed the existing competition with aim of getting deeper insights into how the market functions with respect to such mechanisms. There have been numerous similar products, neither of which has developed into a mature end-product. Having competitors all around the world, was further validation for us to understand the need we identified was real, and we are taking specific care to avoid the mistakes and flaws we notice in already existing products.  

We believe that our processes and our willingness to take things one step further would help us achieve our goals.üëå
